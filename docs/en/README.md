# Grammatical Analysis of German Sentences using Artificial Intelligence

This project aims to analyze the grammatical structure of German sentences using artificial intelligence (AI). The process involves multiple steps to ensure accurate results.

## Key Features

### Text Recognition

- Utilizing OCR technology to extract text from images.

### Grammatical Analysis

- Identifying articles, nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs using a database.
- Assigning a percentage to the probability of the grammatical classification (e.g., 95% feminine article in nominative case).

### AI-based Verification

- Validating the analysis results with AI models such as Gemini and Chat GPT.
- Assigning another percentage based on the AI models' results (e.g., 98% feminine article in nominative case).

### Database Cross-check

- Verifying results against an extensive database of over 2000 analyzed sentences.
- Assigning a percentage based on matches in the database (e.g., 80% feminine article in nominative case).

### Final Evaluation

- Calculating the final result using a formula that combines the various percentages to determine the accuracy of the classification (e.g., 99.4% feminine article in nominative case).

## Target Audience

- **Linguists:** Aid in the analysis and research of the German language.
- **Teachers and Students:** Tool for learning and teaching German grammar.
- **Developers:** Provision of an API for integrating grammatical analysis capabilities into other applications.

This project is open-source and invites the community to contribute to its improvement and expansion.
